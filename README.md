# Summary
The app I will be creating is a text-based RPG for android called `choices’. The app will involve multiple scenarios with multiple different possible outcomes based on the players’ choices throughout. With each option presented players will either find themselves trapped or with the right choices, free.
The player will be presented a scenario and multiple possible text choices at a time. The player will then select a single text option. Through the choices the player decides to go with the story will unfold, leading to various different possible outcomes and replay ability. 
This game has strong mystery aspects and is set on a deserted island, where the player falls into a cave and attempts to escape. The objective of the game is for the player to find the characters personal items that were scattered when the player fell into the cave. 
The overall objective is to escape, which is possible without finding any of the characters personal items however the more items the player finds the easier it becomes to escape.

- Still missing SID and summary here.
- Not enough commits + changelog items to pass at this frequency.
- I couldn't find your text-based data. Create a root folder "data/" and put all your JSON files in there.
- You're still missing a licenses.txt + changelog.md file.
- I can't find any code directory.
