All relevant files will be uploaded to github.

# Henry comments 13/April
- Still missing SID and summary here.
- Not enough commits + changelog items to pass at this frequency.
- I couldn't find your text-based data. Create a root folder "data/" and put all your JSON files in there.
- You're still missing a licenses.txt + changelog.md file.
- I can't find any code directory.
